OPEN SYSTEMS INTERCONNECTION REFERENCE MODEL aka OSI MODEL
Used to describe the way traffic is moving from one part of the network to another.
Consists of 7 unique protocols 
Way to remember from top to bottom:
All People Seems To Need Data Processing

Layer 1: Physical Layer
	The physics of the network
		Signaling, cabling, connectors
	“You have a physical layer problem”
		Fix the cabling, punch-downs, etc
		Runn loopback tests, test/replace cables, swap adaptor cards
	Deals with:
		Cables, fiber, and the signal itself
Layer 2: Data Link Layer
	The basic network “language”
	The foundation of communication at the data link layer
Data Link Control (DLC) protocols
	MAC (Media Access Control) address on the Ethernet
The “switching” layer
Deals with:
Frames, MAC address, Extended Unique Identifier (EUI-48, EUI-64), Switch
